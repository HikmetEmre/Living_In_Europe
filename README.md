A Comprehensive Data Analysis of Living In Europe
For this project, I collected 50,805 rental houses data from local websites using web scraping techniques and analysed the average rent prices across 16 European cities. However, I didn't stop there!â€ŠI also explored additional factors that can influence rental prices, such as job opportunities and salaries, to gain a more comprehensive view of the rental market in Europe. Join me as I uncover insights and patterns that will help shed light on the complexities of the European rental market.

For this project, I collected data on rental prices and other relevant factors such as job opportunities and salaries by scraping public ads on local websites. Web scraping is a technique used to automatically extract data from websites, and in this case, I used it to gather rental price information from various sources. These sources included websites that advertise rental properties and apartments for rent, such as online classifieds, real estate portals, and property management company websites. By scraping public ads, I was able to gather a large volume of data on rental prices and other factors across multiple cities in Europe. It's worth noting that all the data I collected was from publicly available sources and did not involve any private or sensitive information.
